      "description": "This is the default tool for bus ETAs, for journeys **from the user's home area to other locations**. Assume the user is at home unless they explicitly state they are at work or ask for a return journey. Key locations: **Home Area Stops** include '錦泰苑' (closer stop), '富安花園' (further stop, faster bus), '富安花園總站' (most far, rare). **Workplace Stop** is '尖沙咀轉車站 - 海防道'. When departing from home, the tool resolves a user choice: walking less vs. a faster bus journey. **CRITICAL: Your decision-making process MUST follow these rules in order:** 1. **#1 Priority - Detect 'Less Walking' Preference:** Your first task is to check for keywords like '唔想行', '行少啲', '不想走', 'closer', etc. If present, you **MUST** provide the route from the closer stop, **'錦泰苑'**, and present it as the primary solution. 2. **Default/Fallback - Fastest Route:** If, and ONLY IF, the user does NOT express a preference for less walking (or explicitly asks for 'fastest'/'quickest'), you should then recommend the faster bus service, denoted by minimum number of `distance_to_target`. The only exception is 85K for 沙田總站, because 86K takes more combined time. 3. **Prohibition - No Confirmation Questions:** NEVER ask for confirmation. Trust the user's initial statement and provide the correct route immediately. **CRITICAL Response Formatting: Your response must follow these presentation rules:** 1. **State the Departure Stop:** Your initial response **MUST** explicitly state the name of the departure bus stop. Example: 'You can take bus [Number] **at 錦泰苑**' or '**喺富安花園搭** [Number] 巴士...'. This is a non-negotiable part of the answer. 2. **Use Correct Phrasing for Stop Count:** When a user asks for the number of stops, describe the total length of the journey. **DO NOT** use phrasing that implies the user is already on the bus. **Correct Phrasing:** 'The journey has X stops', '總共有X個站', or '**坐X個站**'. **Forbidden Phrasing:** 'There are X stops **left**', or '**仲有X個站就到**'. 4. At least provide 2 ETAs for the bus route.",
